      &lt;h2&gt;Sexual Education in America&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;h3&gt;Put a Rubber on it.....PLEASE&lt;/h3&gt;
      &lt;byline&gt;&lt;span&gt;By Shawna Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;, 9th November 2014&lt;/byline&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="m-article-body"&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The AIDS crisis of the 1980s marked the first time that policymakers began to consider the school system as an appropriate forum for sex education. President Ronald Reagan initiated the first wave of Abstinence Only Until Marriage (AOUM) funding when he signed the 1981 Adolescent Family Life Act.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;AOUM as a sex education policy took off during the 1990s; to date the federal government has poured roughly $1 Billion into this antiquated, religious-based policy. In 2007, Congress renewed the Title V abstinence-only program for another five years. The program provides $50 million grants annually to schools which promote the Administration on Children, Youth and Families’ guidelines. Key among these guidelines is teaching that abstinence from sexual activity is the only way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancies and STDs, as well as teaching that sexual activity outside of marriage causes psychological and physically harmful effects. Programs that receive the funding are forced to comply with the standards for sex education set in place by the George W. Bush administration. These standards require that programs choose from either abstaining from discussing contraception, or talking about them in a negative manner by emphasizing their failure rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="pullquotes"&gt;        These standards require that programs choose from either abstaining from discussing contraception
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;AOUM programs have done little to curb teen pregnancy and STD rates. The Guttmacher Institute presents facts showing that 86% of the decline in teen pregnancy rates from 1995-2002 is attributed to the drastic improvement in contraceptive use. Currently only thirteen states mandate that the information included in their sex education programs be medically accurate and factual. While the teen pregnancy and abortion rates have decreased since their spike in the 90’s, STD infection rates continue to skyrocket alarmingly; according to the Center for Disease Control, the United States STD rate increased by 30% from 2000 to 2008. Approximately 9 million new cases of STDs occur annually. The cost of STDs among adolescents has not been calculated but STDs among the entire adult population cost approximately $8.4 billion per year. Compared to other first world countries the United States has an exceptionally high STD and pregnancy rate among teens.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Not only are AOUM programs proven ineffective, but the majority of American people are actually calling for more Comprehensive Sex Education Programs. Nine in ten teachers and 86% of parents are in favor of more comprehensive programs and expanded time spent on sex education. Despite social conservative arguments to the contrary, premarital sex has been commonly accepted since the 1940’s, with nearly 9 in 10 having sex before marriage. Parents and teachers aren’t the only ones calling for an end to AOUM programs, students also feel that they are unprepared with regard to their reproductive health. Fifty-five percent of 7th-12th graders report researching sex education information online in order to learn more about an issue they were facing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="pullquotes"&gt;        Abstinence only education does not effectively cover sex education for adolescents.
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Leaving adolescents to research health information online is problematic. Forty-six percent of websites examined contain inaccurate information addressing contraception and 35% contained inaccurate abortion information. Half of students in 7th-12th grade said they needed information about what to do in the event of rape or sexual assault, a topic covered by only a small number of comprehensive sex education programs and not covered at all in AOUM programs. AOUM programs are even less effective in assisting minority or low socioeconomic status populations. Abstinence only education does not effectively cover sex education for adolescents. There is an overwhelming need for more comprehensive sex education programs.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Despite the scientific research proving that AOUM programs do not provide adequate sex education for teens, and the growing public health threat of STDs, the federal government continues to fund AOUM programs as the primary sex education policy for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
